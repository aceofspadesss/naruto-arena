The <a href='/ninja-ladder/' class="con" name="ladder">ladder</a> is a solution for everyone who wants to compete with players around the world. It's a <a href='/ninja-ladder/' class="con" name="competition">competition</a> where you are able to compare your <a href='/characters-.and.-skills/' class="con" name="skills">skills</a> to other players. Everyone who joins the site and plays a <a href='/game-manual/' class="con" name="game">game</a> automatically joins the <a href='/ninja-ladder/' class="con" name="ladder">ladder</a>.
<br><br><h5>Ranked / Unranked</h5><br>When you <a href='/register/' class="con" name="register">register</a> on the website you have the ninjarank called Academy student. This basically means you have not won or played any match. An academy student is a so called unranked player.
<br><br>
Whenever you win your first <a href='/game-manual/' class="con" name="game">game</a> you will become a "ranked" player and start at the bottom of the <a href='/ninja-ladder/' class="con" name="ladder">ladder</a>. Also your ninjarank of Academy student will increase to a new ninjarank. Usually you will become a Genin.
<br /><br />
<h5>Climbing up</h5><br />
As said above, when you are ranked you start at the bottom of the <a href='/ninja-ladder/' class="con" name="ladder">ladder</a>. Ofcourse your task is to get higher in the <a href='/ninja-ladder/' class="con" name="ladder">ladder</a>. In the <a href='/ninja-ladder/' class="con" name="ladder">ladder</a> system we created you can increase by winning from players that have a better rank then yourself. You then increase 25% of the difference between you and your opponent.
<br /><br />
For example: When you are ranked 1000 and you win from the player with rank 1. You will become rank 750 in the <a href='/ninja-ladder/' class="con" name="ladder">ladder</a> (The player who is rank 1 will not drop in rank, although he will get a loss added to his "total losses").
<br /><br />
But, it's important to know that we don't look at the losers actual rank when making the calculation above. All players get a certain <b>ninja rank</b>. For the loser the highest <a href='/ninja-ladder/' class="con" name="ladder">ladder</a>rank of your <b>ninja rank</b>-group will count as the rank when making the calculation (see the bottom of this page for the different ninja ranks).
<br /><br />
For example: When you are ranked 1000 and you play versus a player with the rank 150 he might be a special jounin. The highest special jounin is ranked 100. When you beat this player you will increase (1000-100)/4 ranks in the <a href='/ninja-ladder/' class="con" name="ladder">ladder</a>. This is 225 ranks in total. You will become rank 775 (1000-225).
<br /><br />
<h5>The ninja ranks</h5><br />
