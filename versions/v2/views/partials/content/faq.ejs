<h5>What is <a href="/uzumaki-naruto/" class="con" title="Naruto">Naruto</a>?</h5><br>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<a href="/uzumaki-naruto/" class="con" title="Naruto">Naruto</a>
<br><br>
<h5>I cant see how my enemies are attacking me?</h5><br>
Part of the <a href="/game-manual/" class="con" title="game">game</a> is knowledge of the opposing player's <a href="/characters-and-skills/" class="con" title="characters">characters</a> abilities. Maybe we will add some kind of visualisation of skills/attacks in the future. However the vast majority of players will likely be able to recognize the <a href="/characters-and-skills/" class="con" title="skills">skills</a> that have been used in a previous turn (and even predict them) after playing it for an amount of time. To learn of an opposing <a href="/characters-and-skills/" class="con" title="characters">characters</a> abilities, either click on their icon while in<a href="/game-manual/" class="con" title="game">game</a> or look them up in our <a href="/characters-and-skills/" class="con" title="Characters">Characters</a> &amp; <a href="/characters-and-skills/" class="con" title="Skills">Skills</a> section which fully details the abilities of all <a href="/characters-and-skills/" class="con" title="characters">characters</a>. This method will be in place until the necessary improvements have been made.
<br><br>
<h5>Where is <a href="/characters-and-skills/" class="con" title="Character">Character</a> XXX that's currently in the manga?</h5><br>
Since <a href="/uzumaki-naruto/" class="con" title="Naruto">Naruto</a> Arena is heavily reliant on the Anime for its images, and the majority of people playing the <a href="/game-manual/" class="con" title="game">game</a> are mostly fans of the US anime [and aren't yet as far as most people who read the manga that's released on the internet], it will only include <a href="/characters-and-skills/" class="con" title="characters">characters</a> that are present in the anime. Perhaps manga <a href="/characters-and-skills/" class="con" title="characters">characters</a> will be offered to "premium members" (if we ever introduce such a scheme) in the future. Though don't worry, Yondaime Hokage plus a fair amount of new <a href="/characters-and-skills/" class="con" title="characters">characters</a> will soon be introduced in the Anime, as we know that finally the fillers are ending. They will soon be included in the <a href="/game-manual/" class="con" title="game">game</a>. 
<br><br>
<h5>Will you be adding any filler <a href="/characters-and-skills/" class="con" title="characters">characters</a> to the line up?</h5><br>
No and, hell no.
<br><br>
<h5>How can i communicate with my opponent while i'm playing versus him?</h5><br>
At the moment this is simply not possible. An in<a href="/game-manual/" class="con" title="game">game</a> <a href="/naruto-arena-irc-channel/" class="con" title="chat">chat</a> function is one of our <a href="/main/" class="con" title="main">main</a> priorities at this point. You can expect one in the very near future.
Please note that you can use the Private Message function to communicate with other players.
<br><br>
<h5>I was in the middle of a fight and the message 'You Win' unexpectedly showed up, but I didn't defeat the player.</h5><br>
The opposing player either suffered a connection problem or closed his in-<a href="/game-manual/" class="con" title="game">game</a> window.
<br><br>
<h5>At the end of the round a menu comes up regarding chakra. What is this?</h5><br>
If a player uses a <a href="/characters-and-skills/" class="con" title="skill">skill</a> requiring "random chakra" (black) during a round, this menu will appear. The purpose of the menu is to offer an overview of your current chakra pool, from which you can draw a substitute for the "random" chakra. Please note, this menu is in no sense related to the chakra you will gain next round.
<br><br>

<h5>I get a Kisame and <a href="/maito-gai/" class="con" title="Gai">Gai</a> picture or a loss screen after I entered a <a href="/game-manual/" class="con" title="game">game</a>, what should I do ?</h5><br>
The cause of this bug has been found. If the <a href="/game-manual/" class="con" title="game">game</a> is still not working, delete all your cookies and re-<a href="/login/" class="con" title="login">login</a> on the website. The problem occurred when people joined the website with the naruto-arena.com do<a href="/main/" class="con" title="main">main</a> instead of www.naruto-arena.com.

<br><br>
<h5>How do I unlock the other <a href="/characters-and-skills/" class="con" title="characters">characters</a>?</h5><br>

The bottom half of the current <a href="/characters-and-skills/" class="con" title="characters">characters</a> have not been released yet. They will be released as soon as gametester and Mark finish a couple of features plus security for the website. These <a href="/characters-and-skills/" class="con" title="characters">characters</a> however won't be available right from the beginning. You will have to unlock them yourself by completing missions. The lower the <a href="/characters-and-skills/" class="con" title="character">character</a> in the menu, likely the harder the quest. 
And even though these <a href="/characters-and-skills/" class="con" title="characters">characters</a> may be way stronger than the ones in the upper half, when watching the Anime, we want this <a href="/game-manual/" class="con" title="game">game</a> to re<a href="/main/" class="con" title="main">main</a> balanced. Therefore maybe their movesets will be slightly more interesting, but they won't be way more powerful. 

<br><br>
<h5>When I go to sleep and come back I dropped in <a href="/the-ninja-ladder/" class="con" title="ladder">ladder</a> rank, how come?</h5><br>

You are one of the many people that want to move up in the <a href="/the-ninja-ladder/" class="con" title="ladder">ladder</a>. While you were sleeping, people continued to play and passed you on the <a href="/the-ninja-ladder/" class="con" title="ladder">ladder</a>, which would obviously make yourself drop. 
<br><br>
<h5>How does the match-up system work?</h5><br>
Every 60 seconds match-ups are made. The players closest to each other on the <a href="/the-ninja-ladder/" class="con" title="ladder">ladder</a> will play each other.<br><br>
<h5>I want to play versus my friend, but the match-up system is random?</h5><br>

A Private <a href="/game-manual/" class="con" title="game">game</a> option has been one of our priorities since the beginning. Since we kept postponing the release, this feature hasn't been made yet. Sometime soon you will be able to type in the username of a friend, and if that friend does the same likewise, a private battle will start. This feature will only be there for fun and practice purposes. Private matches will not count as a <a href="/the-ninja-ladder/" class="con" title="ladder">ladder</a> match.
<br><br>
<h5>This is first version is called BETA 1.0. Does that mean we will get a <a href="/the-ninja-ladder/" class="con" title="ladder">ladder</a> reset?</h5><br>

Since the <a href="/the-ninja-ladder/" class="con" title="ladder">ladder</a> system only works when a lot of people are ranked, we will not do a <a href="/the-ninja-ladder/" class="con" title="ladder">ladder</a> reset. But we will include a button to reset your rank, wins, losses and win streak. This way people that want to start all over will have be able to start clean without having to make a new <a href="/profile/" class="con" title="account">account</a> &amp; username. 
<br><br>
<h5>Is <a href="/the-ninja-ladder/" class="con" title="ladder">ladder</a> the only <a href="/the-ninja-ladder/" class="con" title="competition">competition</a> that this site will offer?</h5><br>

No, we will be making tournament support in the future. Some of these tournaments might have a little fee and will include prizes to win. Since we haven't really thought too much about tournament support, we don't excactly yet know what it will look like. 
<br><br>
<h5>Will there be any kind of clan support?</h5><br>

So far we didn't plan on making this <a href="/game-manual/" class="con" title="game">game</a> team versus team. The <a href="/game-manual/" class="con" title="game">game</a> will re<a href="/main/" class="con" title="main">main</a> one versus one but this does not mean that there won't be any clan support. Players can team-up with each others under a certain team name. We plan on making a special Clan <a href="/the-ninja-ladder/" class="con" title="Ladder">Ladder</a> which will work the same way as the Solo <a href="/the-ninja-ladder/" class="con" title="Ladder">Ladder</a>. 
<br><br>
<h5>When can we expect a forum to show up?</h5><br>

Of course we understand a forum is eventually needed. However the person assigned to create this forum is in the last weeks of his study. We do not plan on using a open source or licensed forum such as vBulletin. We create our own forum that suits the <a href="/game-manual/" class="con" title="game">game</a> and the site best. Please bare with it for a couple more weeks. 
<br><br>
<h5>The admins don't appear to be doing anything. What the * is going on?!</h5><br>

First off, the <a href="/game-manual/" class="con" title="game">game</a> is offered to all you <a href="/uzumaki-naruto/" class="con" title="Naruto">Naruto</a> fans for free. We admins have already spent a lot of time trying to get the <a href="/game-manual/" class="con" title="game">game</a> working as it does right now. And we intend to keep this up by working on it as much as we can in our own free time. Even when it does appear to you the staff is slacking off, please do respect our effort and time put into it up to this point. <br>
As of now, gametester and Mark are mostly busy trying to improve security (against hackers and such) and finish a couple of features that had been planned from the start. It may take still a couple of weeks until actual improvements or additions are noticable by you members. 

<br><br>
<h5>I want to <a href="/the-basics/" class="con" title="help">help</a> making the <a href="/game-manual/" class="con" title="game">game</a> better! Can I join the staff?</h5><br>

While we are still working out our basic ideas we have no spots for new people, as of yet. As soon as we're done with several features we had planned from the beginning, we will start looking for people who want to <a href="/the-basics/" class="con" title="help">help</a> designing, balancing and moderating the website and forum. Give it some time. <br><br>
Concerning moderators, we will likely be assigning people who have shown to have a wide knowledge of the <a href="/game-manual/" class="con" title="game">game</a> plus are quite known to be both helpful and handle things on an overall mature level, rather than people simply screaming to be a mod from the beginning. That's the difference between someone who's merely doing it for the title (and will be more likely to abuse his/her powers) or someone with an actual interest in helping out and improving the site as a whole. In most cases, asking to become a <a href="/profile/" class="con" title="moderator">moderator</a> will make you lose any chance of ever becoming one. 
<br><br>
<h5> Future Plans for <a href="/uzumaki-naruto/" class="con" title="Naruto">Naruto</a> Arena </h5><br>

These plans are subject to change at any time without prior notification, they are just incidators of what our grand visions of future Naruto-Arena looks like. We may <a href="/search/" class="con" title="find">find</a> that many of these are currently not on the horizon, however we would like to share our vision with you, the players.
