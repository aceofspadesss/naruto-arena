        Before you <a href='/game-manual/' class="con" name="start playing">start playing</a> it's important that you
        know the basics of the <a href='/game-manual/' class="con" name="game">game</a>. This page gives you an
        introduction to the <a href='/game-manual/' class="con" name="game">game</a>play.
        <br /><br />
        <h5>A battle</h5><br><br>
        <b>The core</b><br>
        A naruto-arena.com battle is a 3 versus 3 match. Both you and your opponent select 3 <a
            href='/characters-and-skills/' class="con" name="characters">characters</a> that will fight till one of
        the teams is completely down. Each <a href='/characters-and-skills/' class="con" name="character">character</a>
        starts with 100 healthpoints. Your task is to get your opponent's <a href='/characters-and-skills/' class="con"
            name="characters">characters</a> to zero health. In order to do
        this, you will work out tactics and strategies to damage your opponents.
        <br /><br />

        By using chakra, the <a href='/characters-and-skills/' class="con" name="characters">characters</a> are able
        to perform <a href='/characters-and-skills/' class="con" name="skills">skills</a>. These <a
            href='/characters-and-skills/' class="con" name="skills">skills</a> can for example stun, defend or damage
        <a href='/characters-and-skills/' class="con" name="characters">characters</a> in the <a href='/game-manual/'
            class="con" name="game">game</a>. Each round a player can perform <b>one <a href='/characters-and-skills/'
                class="con" name="skill">skill</a></b> with <b>each</b> <a href='/characters-and-skills/' class="con"
            name="character">character</a> (as long as your chakra supply allows you so). A player's turn needs to be
        finished within 60 seconds. Whenever a player is done selecting <a href='/characters-and-skills/' class="con"
            name="skills">skills</a>, he/she clicks the 'PRESS WHEN READY' button. After this, it's the opponent's turn.
        <br /><br />

        <b>Choosing</b> <b>skills</b><br><img src="/images/content/30/basics4.jpg" align="right">
        When you are in a battle, you can select <a href='/characters-and-skills/' class="con" name="skills">skills</a>
        to perform. First you have to click one of the 3 <a href='/characters-and-skills/' class="con"
            name="characters">characters</a> you chose before the start of
        the match. After this you are able to select a <a href='/characters-and-skills/' class="con"
            name="skill">skill</a> where the chakra requirment is met. Therefore <a href='/characters-and-skills/'
            class="con" name="skills">skills</a> that can't be performed due to insufficient chakra will be turned grey.
        After you select a <a href='/characters-and-skills/' class="con" name="skill">skill</a>, certain <a
            href='/characters-and-skills/' class="con" name="characters">characters</a> will have a yellow overlay.
        When the overlay is fading it means that you have to choose between certain <a href='/characters-and-skills/'
            class="con" name="characters">characters</a>. When the overlay is not fading you can simply click the <a
            href='/characters-and-skills/' class="con" name="character">character</a> that you wish to target. When
        you want to remove a <a href='/characters-and-skills/' class="con" name="skill">skill</a>, you can click on
        the slots near the <a href='/characters-and-skills/' class="con" name="character">character</a>'s avatar. The
        chakra is then of course re-added to your chakra pool.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Chakra</b><br>
        At the start of a battle, one of the players will get 1 chakra. This is the player that is able to do the first
        move. When his turn is over, the opponent starts off 3 chakra. After the first round, both players will recieve
        1 chakra for every <a href='/characters-and-skills/' class="con" name="character">character</a> that is alive
        in their team. The player gets his/her chakra at the start of each turn. Chakra that is not used will still be
        available during the next rounds. Please note that the black T Symbol represents the sum of all your chakra. It
        is an indicator of how much ?random? chakra you have.
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Chakra types</h5><br>
        As mentioned above chakra is used to perform <a href='/characters-and-skills/' class="con"
            name="skills">skills</a>. Every <a href='/characters-and-skills/' class="con" name="skill">skill</a> uses
        a different set of chakra.<br />
        There are 4 types of chakra:<br />
        <img src="/images/chakra/bloodline.gif" class="chakra"> Bloodine</li><Br />
        <img src="/images/chakra/ninjutsu.gif" class="chakra"> Ninjutsu</li><br />
        <img src="/images/chakra/taijutsu.gif" class="chakra"> Taijutsu</li><br />
        <img src="/images/chakra/genjutsu.gif" class="chakra"> Genjutsu</li><br />
        <br>
        The chance to get a certain chakra is 25% for each, as there are four types. This means that it is random, and
        that you can also get multiple chakras of one type. Next to these 4 types, some <a
            href='/characters-and-skills/' class="con" name="skills">skills</a> require random chakra <img
            src="/images/chakra/random.gif" class="chakra">. This kind of chakra can be filled in by any of the types
        above. At the end of a player's turn he or she is able to choose what type of chakra the 'random chakra(s)' will
        stand for. You simply click on the + next to the chakra type you want to use. Of course, - is used to get these
        chakra back into your chakra pool, if you feel you've made a wrong desicion.
