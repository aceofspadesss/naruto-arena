Up until now Sakura was always unable to play a decent role in battle, yet she had great controle over her chakra and she is an excellent student. These are the exact skills that are needed to become a medical ninja. Sakura hopes to get training from Tsunade herself, but first she will need to learn the basics from Shizune. However, to actually get training from Shizune, Sakura will have to prove herself worthy.</p>",
